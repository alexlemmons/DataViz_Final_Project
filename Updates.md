## March 21

Explored data sets in R, solidified inputs (Ht, Wt, ect.), and explored more output options.

## March 23 Beginning of Class

Tidy'd data set and filtered out a QB data set.

## March 23 End of Class

Solidified output plans. Compare arbitrary player input stats against starters. Tidy'd data, added missing data.

## March 28 Beginning of Class

Did a lot. Tidy'd all data, created all plots, completed a prototype app. Basically created a complete and fully working app, now just have to make it look pretty.

## March 28 End of Class

Added means for default inputs. Worked on figuring out how to make it prettier (adjusting graph and sidebar size).

## April 6 Before Class

Working on finding a way to make the graphs smaller so they fit better and look prettier.

## April 6 End of Class

Worked with different layouts for the tabs, not sold on either yet.

## April 18 Before Class

Still trying to manipulate the dimensions of the app to be more visually appealing yet still as useful.

## April 18 After Class

Successfully discovered my preferred visual scheme for my app.

## April 20 Before Class

Researched and worked on turning my graphs into interactive plotly graphs.

## April 20 After Class

Fumbled around with the plotly. Currently trying to figure out how to change the label variable names.

<<<<<<< HEAD
## April 25 Before Class

Semi-successfully implemented plotly. Been researching and working on a way to change the variable names in the plotly so they're not "full_join..." with no luck.

Hey Alex, neither of your before class commits this week show any evidence of anything that you worked on (no code was changed at all in any of your files).

## April 25 After Class

Semi-success is now mostly failure as the plotly graph isn't working for some unholy reason I cannot figure out. I've researched and have seemingly done everything necessary. I do not get an error or anything it is just blank in the app. I shall rest and pray a fortnight, then I will return to this problem well rested with a new outlook. 

Also sorry about the previous commits, I was making up a lot of work last week and didn't have a lot of time.

## April 27 Before Class

Still having trouble with the plotly. Research has largely gone nowhere. I appear to be doing everything right and my test plot works. Will look more into this today.

## April 27 After Class

Still haven't figured out the plotly. Looking for help.

## May 2 Before Class

Never figured out the plotly. I have converted all graphs back to static graphs.

## May 2 After Class

Working on trying to add another comparison plot to compare multiple variable against each other.
